- name: Slang Netlist
  desc: |
    Slang Netlist is built on top of [slang](https://sv-lang.com) for analysing the
    source-level static connectivity of a SystemVerilog design. It uses slang's AST
    and data-flow analyses to construct a dependency graph of operations and provides
    facilities for interacting with this data structure.

- name: Hex processor
  desc: |
    The Hex Architecture is a very simple processor intended for explaining how
    a computer works. This repository contains an implementation in Verilog and
    basic tooling written in C++ for developing programs (a compiler, assembler
    and simulator). It was written out of curiosity and to serve as an example
    of how high-level programs relate to the underlying hardware
    implementation.

    A C++ simulator and SystemVerilog implementation (the latter is still a
    WIP) of the RISC-V 32IM architecture that I developed to learn about
    RISC-V.

- name: PRNG testing
  desc: |
    This repository contains facilities for comprehensively testing PRNGs using
    statistical test suites. It provides a facility to run a PRNG against
    TestU01, PractRand and Gjrand, with parallel runs from different seeds and
    permutations of the output bits, and a script for summarising results
    across all the runs. This testing methodology was used for the
    investigation in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04058).

    A Python-based project that I use to analyse data exported from my Vaillant
    heat pump monitoring. It reads in the raw CSV files produced by the Vaillant
    smartphone app and renders a set of charts and statistics in HTML.

    A Python-based project that I use to fetch personal finance data (collected
    transactions from bank accounts and credit cards etc) held in Google
    Sheets and then generate a set of summary HTML reports including tables and charts.

- name: Netlist Paths
  desc: |
    Netlist Paths is a library and command-line tool for querying a Verilog
    netlist. It reads an XML representation of a design's netlist, produced by
    [Verilator](https://www.veripool.org/projects/verilator), and provides
    facilities for inspecting types, variables and paths. The library is
    written in C++ and has a Python interface. This project has now been
    superseded by Slang Netlist (see above).

    An implementation of a language and runtime system for dynamic process
    creation. There are two versions: an initial one written in C that directly
    targeted the XMOS XS1 architecture, and a rewrite in Python targeting XS1
    via the [XC language](/the-xc-programming-language.html).
