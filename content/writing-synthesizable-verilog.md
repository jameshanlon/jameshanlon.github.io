> **_NOTE:_**  Updated February 2024 with improvements and new guidance.

In the last year, I've started from scratch writing SystemVerilog for hardware
design. Coming from a software background where I was mainly using C/C++ and
Python, it has been interesting to experience the contrasting philosophy and
mindset associated with using a language to describe hardware circuits. Much of
this is because SystemVerilog provides little abstraction of hardware
structures, and only through disciplined/idiomatic use, can efficient designs
be implemented. A compounding issue is that complex hardware designs rely on a
complex ecosystem of proprietary tooling.

As I see it, there are three aspects to writing synthesizable SystemVerilog
code: the particular features of the language to use, the style and idioms
employed in using those features, and the tooling support for a design. Good
coding style can help achieve better results in synthesis and simulation, as
well as producing code that contains less errors and is understandable,
reusable, and easily modifiable. Many of the observations in this note relate
to coding style. The next sections give some context around the use of
SystemVerilog in digital design, or you can [skip ahead](#guidance) to the
guidance.


### The SystemVerilog language

SystemVerilog (which subsumed Verilog as of the 2009 standardisation) is a
unified language, serving distinct purposes of modern hardware design. These
can be enumerated as:

- Circuit design/specification at different levels of abstraction:
    * Behavioural.
    * Structural/register-transfer level (RTL).
    * Gate.
    * Switch/transistor.
- Testbench-based verification.
- Specification of formal properties.
- Specification of functional coverage.

SystemVerilog provides specific features to serve each of these
purposes. For circuit specification, each level of abstraction uses a different
language subset, generally with fewer features at lower levels. Behavioural
design uses the procedural features of SystemVerilog (with little regard for the
structural realisation of the circuit). RTL design specifies a circuit in terms
of data flow through registers and logical operations. Gate- and switch-level
design use only primitive operations. Typical modern hardware design uses a mix
of register-transfer- and gate-level design.

It is interesting to note that the SystemVerilog specification does not specify
which features are synthesizable; that depends on the tooling used.


### Tooling

There is a variety of standard tooling that is used with SystemVerilog, and
indeed other hardware description languages (HDLs). This includes simulation,
formal analysis/model checking, formal equivalence checking, coverage analysis,
synthesis and physical layout, known collectively as electronic design
automation tools (EDA). Since standard EDA tooling is developed and maintained
as proprietary and closed-source software by companies like Cadence, Synopsys
and Mentor, the tooling options are multiplied.

In contrast with the open-source software ecosystems of programming languages
(for example), closed-source EDA tools do not benefit from the scale and
momentum of open projects, in the way that conventional software languages do,
with a one (or perhaps two) compilers and associated tooling such as debuggers
and program analysers. Such a fragmented ecosystem inevitably has a larger
variability in precisely how features of SystemVerilog language are implemented
and which features are not supported, particularly since there is no standard
synthesizable subset. Consequently, engineers using SystemVerilog/HDLs with
proprietary EDA tools do so conservatively, sticking to a lowest common
denominator of the language features (within their chosen synthesizable
subset), to ensure compatibility and good results.

## Overview

This note records rules, conventions and guidance for writing SystemVerilog
approaches that I have been observed to interact well with the supporting
tooling and to encourage good coding style and produce good synthesis results.
I owe many of these insights to the guidance of my colleagues.

<a name="types" class="anchor"></a>
## Types

**`logic` should be used to declare point-to-point nets, variables and ports.**
This is because logic is checked at compile time for multiple drivers. Note
that variables are entities driven by procedural assignments (in always
blocks), whereas nets occur in any other forms of assignment (continuous,
primitive outputs and module ports). An exception to this is when integrating
external IP that uses wire types where some sparing use of the `wire` type may
be required for consistency.[^logic-wire-reg]

[^logic-wire-reg]: More details on these types is given
  [here](https://blogs.sw.siemens.com/verificationhorizons/2013/05/03/wire-vs-reg) and
  [here](https://www.verilogpro.com/verilog-reg-verilog-wire-systemverilog-logic).

**Multiply-driven nets should be declared using wire.** This is because `wire`
data types permit multiple drivers.

**Combined logic declarations and assignment statements are not allowed.** The behaviour of these is to assign
a value at time 0, which is not synthesizable. Continuous assignment after time 0, which is the typical intention,
requires a separate assignment. Note that a combined assignment with a wire declaration behaves differently
and is equivalent to a separate continuous assignment.

``` verilog
// Assignment of a logic net at time 0, not allowed.
logic [31:0] data = 32'b0;

// Correct way to continuously drive a logic net.
logic [31:0] data;
assign data = 32'b0;

// Wire declarations can use an initial value to specify a continuous
// assignment.
wire value = 0;

// Same behaviour as above declaration.
wire value;
assign value = 0;
```

**Structures and unions must always be fully packed.** This applies
to their members recursively. For example:

``` verilog
typedef struct packed { // Packed structure.
  valid_t             valid;
  logic [p_width-1:0] data; // Packed array.
  logic               parity;
} bus_t;
```

<a name="always-blocks" class="anchor"></a>
## Always blocks

The `always_ff`, `always_latch` and `always_comb` constructs should be used instead of the old-style always statement
since they provide extra compile-time checking.[^always-blocks]

[^always-blocks]: With one exception of memory structures that require
  initialisation via an external hierarchical reference. If the memory array is
  written by an `always_` block, the memory cannot be driven by another process.
  Support for `$deposit` is patchy in tooling, so this cannot always be relied
  on.

<a name="always_comb" class="anchor"></a>
### `always_comb`

**Use `always_comb` instead of `always` for combinatorial logic.** The
`always_comb` statement allows tools to check that it does not contain any
latched state and that no other processes assign to variables appearing on the
left-hand side. (It's worth checking the LRM for details of of the other
differences.) The use of an `always_comb` block is also a much clearer
indication of a combinatorial block that the use of `=` as opposed to `<=`.

**Always provide an initial value.** A latch will be inferred if there exists a
control-flow path in which a value of a signal is not set. Since `always_comb`
specifically precludes the creation of latches, doing so will cause a warning
or error in simulation or synthesis. For example, the following code implies a
latch since there is no assignment to `foo` when the condition is not true.

``` verilog
always_comb begin
  if (condition) begin
    foo = 1'b1;
  end
end
```

To prevent this, always provide an initial value as the first line of a block:

``` verilog
always_comb begin
  foo = 1'b0;
  if (condition) begin
    foo = 1'b1;
  end
end
```

**Avoid reading and writing a signal in an `always_comb` block.**
Avoid reading and writing a signal in an `always_comb` block. The sensitivity
list only includes variables that are read in expressions or functions and it
excludes variables that are also written to. According to these restrictions, a
variable that is read and written in a block is excluded from the sensitivity
list, and activation of the block will be dependent on other variables.
However, this style can cause some tools to warn of a simulation-synthesis
mismatch (presumably because they apply conservative rules from older versions
of the language standard).

In the following code, the block is triggered only when the the right-hand-side
`foo` changes, rather than entering a feedback loop where it shifts continuously:

``` verilog
always_comb begin
  foo = foo << 1;
end
```

To avoid reading and writing `foo` in the same block and possible warnings
from tools, a new signal can be introduced:

``` verilog
always_comb begin
  next_foo = foo << 1;
end
```

**Where possible extract logic into `assign` statements.** Extract single
assignments to a variable into a separate `assign` statement, where it is
possible to do so. This approach uses the features of SystemVerilog
consistently, rather than using two mechanisms to achieve the same effect. This
makes it clear that an `always_comb` is used to introduce sequentiality.
Another opportunity to move logic into separate `assign` statements is with
complex expressions, such as the Boolean value for a conditional statement.
Doing this makes the control flow structure clearer, potentially provide
opportunities for reuse, and provides a separate signal when inspecting the
signals in a waveform viewer.

**Avoid unnecessary sequentiality.** It is easy to add statements to an
`always_comb` to expand its behaviour, but this should only be done when there
are true sequential dependencies between statements in the block. In general,
parallelism should be exposed where ever possible. In the the following
example, the sequentiality is not necessary since the output `set_foo` depends
independently on the various conditions:

``` verilog
always_comb begin
  set_foo = 1'b0;
  if (signal_a &&
      signal_b) begin
    set_foo = 1'b1;
  end
  if (signal_c ||
      signal_d) begin
    set_foo = 1'b1;
  end
  if (signal_e) begin
    set_foo = 1'b1;
  end
end
```

Clearly the sequencing of the conditions is not necessary, so the block could
be transformed to separate the logic for each condition into separate parallel
processes (extracting into `assign` statements as per the rule above) and
explicitly combine them with the implied logical disjunction of the original
block:

``` verilog
assign condition_a = signal_a && signal_b;
assign condition_b = signal_c || signal_d;
always_comb begin
  set_foo = 1'b0;
  if (condition_a ||
      condition_b ||
      signal_e) begin
    set_foo = 1'b1;
  end
end
```

It is [recommended][verilator-internals] by the author of Verilator to split up
``always`` blocks (combinatorial or sequential) so they contain as few
statements as possible. This allows Verilator the most freedom to order the
code to improve execution performance. Presumably, this provides similar
freedoms to other simulators.

**Drive one signal per block.** With complex control flow statements, it is
tempting to use a single `always_comb` block to drive multiple signals. In some
circumstances, there may be good reasons to do this, such as when many output
signals are used in a similar way, but in the general case, splitting each
signal into a separate block makes it clear what logic involved in driving that
signal, and as such, facilitates further simplification.

An additional reason to avoid driving multiple signals per `always_comb` block
is that [Verilator][verilator] can infer a dependence between two signals,
leading to false circular combinatorial loops. In these cases, it issues an
[`UPOPTFLAT` warning][unoptflat] and cannot optimise the path, leading to
reduced emulation performance. Generally, fixing warnings pertaining to
unoptimisable constructs can improve Verilator's simulation performance by [up
to a factor of two][verilator-internals].

[verilator-internals]: https://www.veripool.org/papers/verilator_philips_internals.pdf
[verilator]: https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator
[unoptflat]: https://www.embecosm.com/appnotes/ean6/html/ch07s02s07.html

The process:

``` verilog
always_comb begin
  foo = foo_q;
  bar = bar_q;
  if (condition_a)
    case (condition_b)
      0: begin
        foo = ...;
        if (condition_c) begin
          bar = ...;
        end
      end
      1: foo = ...;
      2: bar = ...;
      default:;
    endcase
end
```

Can be written as two independent processes:

``` verilog
always_comb begin
  foo = foo_q;
  if (condition_a)
    case (condition_b)
      0: foo = ...;
      1: foo = ...;
      default:;
    endcase
end

always_comb begin
  bar = bar_q;
  if (condition_a)
    case (condition_b)
      0: if (condition_b) begin
           bar = ...;
         end
      2: bar = ...;
      default:;
    endcase
end
```

<a name="always_ff" class="anchor"></a>
### `always_ff`

**Use `always_ff` instead of `always` for sequential logic.** Similarly to
`always_comb`, use of `always_ff` permits tools to check that the procedure
only contains sequential logic behaviour (no timing controls and only one event
control) that variables on the left-hand side are not written to by any other
process, and makes clear the intent for sequential logic behaviour with
non-blocking assignments, `<=`.

**Avoid adding logic to non-blocking assignments.** This is primarily a matter
of taste, but having non-blocking assignments in `always_ff` blocks only from a
logic signal name, rather than a logical expression, keeps the block simple and
limits combinatorial logic to `always_comb` blocks and `assign` statements
elsewhere in the module. Since synthesizable `always_ff`s are additionally
restricted in that variables assigned to must have a reset condition of a
constant value, maintaining this clarity aids the designer. Having separate
combinatorial blocks is also useful since it allows the logic signal driving a
flip-flop as well as the registered value to be apparent in a waveform viewer,
particularly when clock gates are used.

A typical pattern when implementing combinatorial logic and registers is to
define the set and clear conditions in an `always_comb` and register the value
in an accompanying `always_ff`, for example:

``` verilog
logic bit;
logic bit_q;

always_comb begin
  bit <= bit_q;
  if (set_condition) begin
    bit = 1'b1;
  end
  if (clear_condition) begin
    bit = 1'b0;
  end
end

always_ff @(posedge i_clk or posedge i_rst) begin
  if (i_rst) begin
    bit_q <= 1'b0;
  end else begin
    bit_q <= bit;
  end
end
```

**Registers should always be reset to a constant value.** Without being reset,
a flip flop will drive X on its output, which can lead to
simulation-versus-synthesis mismatches, potentially obscuring bugs. Having
registers initialised with a defined value precludes these kinds of mismatches.
In the above example, `bit_q` is correctly initialised to 0.

**Avoid using synchronous-reset registers.** These type of flip flops are not
typically used because there are circumstances when a clock is not available
and reset-to-clock paths are not timed in the physical implementation. In cases
where area and power are constrained, non-reset flip flops can instead be
deployed for better savings.

In certain circumstances when it is appropriate to use synchronous-reset registers, then
**avoid mixing synchronous and asynchronous reset signals**.
A reset signal (eg `i_rst`) should not be used as a
synchronous reset for one set of registers and an asynchronous reset for another set. This is because the resets
must be controlled differently by DFT control logic, and use of a single signal may obscure the designer intent.

**Avoid using non-reset registers.** To avoid issues with X values in a design
as far as possible, non-reset registers should only be used when specifically
required to save area and power, such as for the storage elements of a register
file. In certain circumstances when it is appropriate to use non-reset
registers, then **define non-reset registers in a separate `always_ff` block**.
For example:

``` verilog
// A non-reset register.
always_ff @(posedge i_clk) begin
  bit_q <= bit;
end
```

**When non-reset registers are used, a separate form of reset must be
provided.** In the example of a register file, a broadcast write could be used
to initialise the contents to a known state.

## Control flow

<a name="if-statements" class="anchor"></a>
### If statements

**Avoid mixing block control flow with Boolean expressions.** This is because
it make it harder for structural coverage analysis tools to break down complex
conditions into manageable sub terms, or even that analysis will ignore
important conditional context of expressions.

``` verilog
// Replace mixed block control flow and boolean expressions:
if (enabled) begin
  flag = x && y;
  if (flag) begin
    out = a;
  end
end

// With a pure control flow approach:
if (enabled) begin
  if (x && y) begin
    out = a;
  end
end

// Or even better collapsed into a single Boolean expression:
if (enable && x && y) begin
  out = a;
end
```

**Use if-else-if statements to implement priority encoders.** Although a
`priority case` statement can be used to do this, it is easier for designers to
recognise a priority encoder when it is written as an if-else-if statement. For
example:

``` verilog
// Replace an unqualified case:
case (1'b1)
  hold: output = a;
  error: output = b;
endcase

// With an if-else statement:
if (hold) begin
  output = a;
end else if (error) begin
  output = b;
end
```

**Do not use qualifiers with `if`-`else`-`if` statements.** The default
behaviour of if statements is that of `priority`, meaning that one condition is
matched, the conditions are evaluated in sequence and only the body of the
first matching condition is evaluated. For `unique` and `unique0` variants of
`if` statements (one or no matching conditions, which can be evaluated in
parallel), use a `unique`-qualified case statement instead. For example:

``` verilog
// Replace a unique if:
unique if (ctrl == 2'b01) begin
  output = a;
end else if (ctrl == 2'b10) begin
  output = b;
end else begin
  output = c;
end

// With a unique case:
unique case (ctrl)
  2'b01:   output = a;
  2'b10:   output = b;
  default: output = c;
endcase
```

Note that `if` statements are X-optimistic in that a condition that evaluates
to an X is treated as if it were a zero. This behaviour has drawbacks and
benefits, but should be carefully considered since it can be a cause of
divergence in behaviour between simulation and synthesis. In contrast, case
statements do not select conditions with an input X value.

<a name="case-statements" class="anchor"></a>
### Case statements

All case statements should include a qualifier for additional checking and guidance to synthesis. The qualifiers are:

- `unique` to specify that all valid conditions have been listed, exactly one
  condition will always match and the conditions can be evaluated in parallel.
  A violation is reported in a given cycle if no case conditions match or more
  than one case condition is matched.

- `priority` to specify that all valid conditions have been listed, that they
  are evaluated in sequence and only the body of the first matching case is
  evaluated. A violation is only reported if no case conditions match in a given
  cycle.

The behaviour of an unqualified case statement is that of priority, but without
the requirement for any case item expressions to match and the corresponding
violation check. Because case statements are typically used to represent
parallel choices, an unqualified case does not clearly indicate whether the
designer has intended the case be priority or parallel. Adding a qualifier
makes this explicit (leading to the right synthesis result) and adds checking.

It is important to have checking of case behaviour: if a violation is reported
during simulation, then this indicates a mismatch between the behaviour of
simulation and synthesis, which means the synthesized design will not
necessarily be the same as the RTL design being simulated, thereby invalidating
the verification.

Note that if a case condition contains a list of expressions, it is not a
violation of uniqueness if more than one expression matches since they are
selecting the same statement.

**Do not use `unique0` as a case qualifier.** Despite this qualifier being in
the SystemVerilog LRM for more than a decade, tool support for `unique0` is
patchy and sometimes absent. This suggests that adoption of `unique0` is low, so
the EDA companies have not needed to support it comprehensively. As such,
`unique0` should not be used, and instead a unique case with an empty default
should be used, for example:

``` verilog
// Replace a unique0 case:
unique0 case (1'b1)
  1'b0: output = a;
  1'b1: output = b;
endcase

// With a unique case and empty default:
unique case (1'b1)
  1'b0: output = a;
  1'b1: output = b;
  default: ; // Empty default disables the no-matching-condition violation
             // check, making the unique case statement behave like a unique0
             // case.
endcase
```

**If in doubt, use priority case with a default.** If a designer is not completely sure whether the case conditions
are always matches and/or are parallel, then they should use a priority case with a default. This way, the
logic simulated results will always match the synthesized logic.

**The Synopsys full_case/parallel_case compiler directives should not be
used.** Instead, use either the `unique` or `priority` qualifiers, as
shown in the table below:

<table class="table table-striped table-sm">
<thead>
  <th scope="col">SystemVerilog construct</th>
  <th scope="col">Approximate Synopsys pragma equivalent</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td><code>unique case</code> without default</td>
  <td><code>full_case</code> and <code>parallel_case</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>priority case</code> without default</td>
  <td><code>full_case</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>unique case</code> with default</td>
  <td><code>parallel_case</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>priority case</code> with default</td>
  <td>No equivalent</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**The use of defaults in case statements should be used sparingly since they
can obscure designer intent, prevent violation checks from being performed and
change synthesis results.**

Note that default conditions are matched only if no case condition matches, so
they can be used to cover all other case conditions that are not explicitly
specified. Their inclusion in a case statement must be considered carefully.

Defaults can be used to assign a value to a combinatorial signal to avoid
latches from being inferred, however it is clearer to provide a default value
at the beginning of an `always_comb` block (see above). This is because it is
conventional to add a `default` at the end of a `case` statement, which obscures
the effect of a default, possibly leading to bugs. For example:

``` verilog
// Assign a default at the top of the block.
always_comb begin
  next_state = state_q;
  unique case(state_q)
    STATE_A: next_state = STATE_B;
    STATE_B: next_state = STATE_C;
    ...
    STATE_Z: next_state = STATE_A;
    // No need for a default here.
  endcase
end
```

If a condition were to be added around the above case statement, the default
value assignment of `next_state` would remain at the top of the block. On the
other hand, if the default value assignment were done in a default of the case,
and not moved out, a latch would be inferred.

Defaults can be used to trap unexpected case values. However, by specifying
`unique` or `priority`, unexpected case values will cause either of the
no-matching-condition or multiple-conditions matching violation checks to fire.
For example, with a one-hot case select, it is not necessary to add a
`default: $error(...);` case condition to trap values that are not one hot.

There is no `priority0` case statement qualifier, so it is reasonable to
include an empty `default` with a `priority case` to disable the
no-matching-condition violation check, similarly to `unique case`. However, it
is more conventional to use an `if`-`else`-`if` to implement a priority
encoder. Example of a case-based priority encoder:

``` verilog
priority case (cond)
  VALUE_A: ...
  VALUE_B: ...
  VALUE_C: ...
  default: ; // Use an empty default with priority when there are no matching
             // conditions, but could the case equally be written with an
             // if-then-if statement?
endcase
```

Empty defaults might also be used to plug coverage holes. This can occur when
the coverage tool expects to see all input combinations and does not understand
when these are prevented by design, eg with one-hot encoding. Adding an empty
default may plug this coverage hole, however doing this will typically change
the synthesis results because it implies an additional decode/control signal to
select the default block, which is probably not what the designer intended. In
such a situation, designers should add coverage waivers where a lack of a
default case creates a coverage hole rather than changing the RTL to add an
empty default case.

``` verilog
// Since the case is unique, the empty default is not necessary and will be
// dead code, and may change the synthesis results.
unique case (four_bit_one_hot_select)
  4'b0001: output = i_a;
  4'b0010: output = i_b;
  4'b0100: output = i_c;
  4'b1000: output = i_d;
  default: ; // This default is not necessary if the case conditions are
             // activated every cycle.
endcase
```

**Use `unique case (1'b1)` for one-hot conditions.** For example, a one-hot
multiplexer can be written:

``` verilog
module m_one_hot_mux3 (
    input  logic       i_a,
    input  logic       i_b,
    input  logic       i_c,
    input  logic [2:0] i_sel,
    output logic       o_out
  );

  always_comb begin
    unique case (1'b1)
      i_sel[0]: o_out = i_a;
      i_sel[1]: o_out = i_b;
      i_sel[2]: o_out = i_c;
    endcase
  end
endmodule
```

As an aside, it is convenient to define a one-hot encoding in a `union` type
with another `struct` to provide named access to each member. For example,
`status_q` above could be redefined as:

``` verilog
typedef enum logic [2:0] {
  STATUS_START = 3'b001,
  STATUS_END   = 3'b010,
  STATUS_ERROR = 3'b100
} status_enum_t;

typedef union packed {
  status_enum_t u;
  struct packed {
    logic status_start;
    logic status_end;
    logic status_error;
  } ctrl;
} status_t;

status_t status_q;
```

Bear in mind however that this union introduces potential for the control structure to correspond incorrectly with
the enumeration, which may introduce bugs into the design.

**Minimise the amount of logic inside a case statement.** The rationale for
this is similar to extracting logic from `always_comb` blocks into `assign`
statements where possible: to make the control flow structure clearer to the
designer and tooling, and to provide opportunities for reuse or
further simplification. For example, avoid nesting `case` statements:

``` verilog
status_t status_q;
status_t next_status;
logic [3:0] mode_q;

always_comb begin
  next_status = state_q;
  unique case(1'b1)
    status_q.ctrl.stat_start:
      unique0 case (mode) inside
        4'b000?,
        4'b0?00: next_status = STATUS_ERROR;
        default: next_status = STATUS_END;
      endcase
    status_q.ctrl.status_end: ...;
    status_q.ctrl.status_error: ...;
  endcase
end
```

And instead extract a nested `case` into a separate process, providing a
result signal to use in the parent case:
```
status_t status_q;
status_t next_status;
status_t start_next_status;
logic [3:0] mode_q;

always_comb begin
  start_next_status = state_q;
  case (mode_q) inside
    4'b000?,
    4'b0?00: start_next_status = STATUS_ERROR;
    default: start_next_status = STATUS_END;
  endcase
end

always_comb begin
  unique case(1'b1)
    status_q.ctrl.status_start: next_status = start_next_status;
    status_q.ctrl.status_end: ...;
    status_q.ctrl.status_error: ...;
  endcase
end
```

Although this example seems simple, the `case`-based logic driving a state
machine can quickly become complicated.

**Use `case inside` for matching with don't cares.** For example:

``` verilog
localparam p_done  = 4'd0,
           p_init  = 4'd1,
           p_end   = 4'd2,
           p_error = 4'd3;

logic [2:0] status;
logic [3:0] next_state;

always_comb begin
  priority case (status) inside
    3'b00?: next_state = p_done;
    3'b01?: next_state = p_init;
    3'b1?0: next_state = p_end;
    3'b1?1: next_state = p_error;
  endcase
end
```

**Unless matching upon `'bX` or `'bZ` is genuinely required, then `casex` or
`casez` should not be used.** Instead, the `case inside` construct should be
used to indicate don't-care bits in the case select as per the previous
example.

<a name="expressions" class="anchor"></a>
## Expressions

**Make operator associativity explicit.** This is to avoid any ambiguity over
the ordering of operators. In particular, always bracket the condition of a
ternary/conditional expression (`?:`), especially if you are nesting them,
since they associate left to right, and all other arithmetic and logical
operators associate right to left.

``` verilog
... = (a && b) ||
      (c && d)
... = |(a[7:0] & b[7:0])
... = valid && (|a[3:0])
... = (a == b) ? c : d
... = cond_a              ? e1 :
      (cond_b && !cond_c) ? e2 :
                            e3
... = !(a[1:0] inside {2'b00, 2'b01}) &&
      ^(b[31:0])
```

**Make expression bit lengths explicit.** Although the SystemVerilog
specification provides rules for the extension of operands as inputs to binary
operations and assignments, these are complicated and not always obvious. In
particular, the extension is determined either by the operands or by the
context of the expression. Since there may be inconsistencies between tools,
particularly between simulation and synthesis, explicitly specifying expression
bit widths avoids these issues and makes the intent obvious. For example, pad
the result of a narrower expression for assignment:

``` verilog
logic [31:0] result;
logic [7:0] op1, op2;
assign result = {24'b0, {op1 & op2}};
```

Use an explicit type cast to specify the width of an intermediate expression
(note that integer literals are interpreted as 32-bit integers):

``` verilog
always_ff @(posedge i_clk or posedge i_rst)
  value_q <= i_rst ? value_t'(42) : value;
```

Special care should be taken with sub expressions, since their result length is
determined automatically by the width of the largest operand. For example,
without an explicit type cast to a 17-bit result around `a + b`, the carry out
bit would be lost:

``` verilog
logic [15:0] result, a b;
typedef logic [16:0] sum_t;
assign result = sum_t'(a + b) >> 1;
```

Capture carry out bits (even if they are unused) so the left-hand-side
assignment width matches the full width of the right hand side. Using a prefix
like `unused_` makes the process of signing off any related warnings with the
downstream synthesis and physical build simpler:

``` verilog
assign {unused_co, result} = a + b;
```

Exceptions to this rule can be made for the common constants 0, 1 and -1 to be
specified as `integer` literals, for example:

``` verilog
assign result = 0;
assign sum = value - 1;
```

**Use `signed` types for signed arithmetic, and avoid implementing signed
arithmetic with manual sign extensions.** SystemVerilog uses the signedness of
an expression to determine how to extend its width (as well as inferring
signedness of parent expressions). Since the rules for sign determination is
similar to expression size but not the same, making it explicit avoids errors.
It also facilitates the use of optimised arithmetic implementations in
synthesis, particularly with multipliers. The following example (adapted from
[this presentation][arithmetic-gotcha]) shows how these rules can be confusing:

``` verilog
logic signed [3:0] a, b;
logic signed [4:0] sum;
logic ci;
sum = a + b + ci; // Unsigned addition due to unsigned ci.
sum = a + b + signed'(ci); // Signed addition, but ci == 1'b1 will be
                           // sign extended to 4'b1111 or -1.
sum = a + b + signed'({1'b0, ci}); // Safe sign extension.
```

Note that an operation is only considered signed if all of the operands are
signed, and that literal values can be specified as signed, for example:
`2'sb11` is -1 in 2 bits.

[arithmetic-gotcha]: http://www.sutherland-hdl.com/papers/2006-SNUG-Boston_standard_gotchas_presentation.pdf

**Avoid splitting arithmetic between statements or modules.** This facilitates
optimisation during synthesis, for example, to choose or generate an optimised
adder implementation for the given set of operands and carry ins/outs. Instead
of:

``` verilog
logic [3:0] a, b, c;
logic [4:0] int_sum, sum;
int_sum = a + b;
{unused_co, sum} = int_sum + {1'b0, c};
```

All of the arithmetic contributing to `sum` can be written in a single
expression:

``` verilog
{unused_co, sum} = a + b + c;
```

**Do not mix bitwise and logical operator in the same expression.** There are
different precedence rules for the types, so the behaviour may not be what is
expected. Instead, break up the expression to make it explicit what the
intended behaviour is.


<a name="constants" class="anchor"></a>
## Constants

**Avoid magic numbers.** All numeric constants, with the exception of zero and
one (for incrementing) should be defined symbolically. All assignment to
constants must be sized correctly to avoid width-mismatch warnings that must be
signed off later in the flow.

**Constants should be declared inside packages.** Derived constants with a
meaning specific to a module should be defined in the appropriate scope of the
module.

**Constants assigned to an `enum` port must be of the same `enum` type.** Not
doing so relies on an implicit conversion, which can have inconsistent
behaviour between tools. Assign an `enum` value directly, or by using a static
cast. For example:

``` verilog
package m_foo_pkg;
  typedef logic [1:0] {
    A, B, C, D
  } enum_t;
endpackage

module m_foo (
  input m_foo_pkg::enum_t in,
  ...
);
...
endmodule

module m_bar (...);
  ...
  m_foo u_foo (
    // Tie the input to a constant value using the enum type, rather than
    // via a value of any other type.
    .in(m_foo_pkg::D),
    ...
  );
  ...
endmodule
```

**Be explicit when assigning values to nets and variables.** For example:

``` verilog
logic [127:0] data_a;

// Explicitly 32 bits wide, decimal 0 assigment.
assign data_a = 128'd0;

// Explicitly 32 bits wide, binary 0 assignment.
assign data_a = 128'b0;

// Avoid.
assign data_a = 'd5;

// A user-defined type.
foo_pkg::bar data_b;

// An implicit cast is acceptable.
assign data_b = 'd5;

// But an explicit one is best.
assign data_b = foo_pkg::bar'(5);
```

With the exception of `'0`, unsized literal single-bit values (unsigned and
without a radix) in assignments should not be used in combinatorial logic,
since they can be misinterpreted. They appear similar to explicit assignments
with a radix, yet represent very different values. For example, `'1` looks
similar to `'d1` but encodes the value $2^n - 1$ where $n$ is the width of the
variable being assigned to.

``` verilog
logic [15:0] data;

// Sets data to 16'hFFFF, not 16'h0001.
assign data = '1;

// Clearer and harder to misinterpret.
assign data = 16'hFFFF;

// The replication operator should be used to set all bits to a value.
assign data = { 16 {1'b1} }; // Equivalent to above assigment

// Acceptable since repeated zeroes are still zero.
assign data = '0;
assign data = 16'h0; // Equivalent
```


<a name="x-values" class="anchor"></a>
## X values

**Assignment of `X` values as don't care values should be avoided.** This is
for similar reasons for not using non-reset registers, which can lead to
simulation-versus-synthesis mismatches, potentially obscuring bugs. However, if
it can be demonstrated that use of X values can provide better QoR in the
physical build of a block, specific and limited use of `X` values can be
justified.



<a name="naming" class="anchor"></a>
## Naming

Clear and consistent naming is important for a design to be easily understood
and maintainability by a designer, but naming must facilitate easy manipulation
by various tools in the RTL and physical design flows.

During RTL debug, names should allow simple sorting and searching in a
wave viewer. By using common prefixes for related signals, sorting will place
them together. Similarly, common substrings are useful to filter a subset of
signals over, for example to select a set of registers or similar signals
different in pipeline stages.

Throughout the physical design flows, names must allow sensible flattening. It
is typical for synthesis to flatten the hierarchical structure and consequently
symbol names are derived from their place in the module hierarchy. A suitable
naming scheme really only requires consistency across a design. As an example,
a flip-flop clock pin might be named
`u_toplevel_u_submodule_p0_signal_q_reg_17_/CK` corresponding to the register
`u_toplevel/u_submodule/p0_signal_q[17]`.

**Names should be meaningful, whilst avoiding excessive verbosity.** For example,
`n3` should be avoided as it lacks meaning whereas `floating_point_opcode_bus` is
excessively long. `fp_opcode` is a reasonable compromise.

**Avoid using C/C++/Verilog/SystemVerilog/VHDL keywords as names.** Even if
they are not reserved names in the language being used in that file. For
example: `auto`, `unsigned`, `task`, `register` or `asm`.

**All names must be all lower case and underscore separated.**
For example:
```
module m_cpu;
module m_cpu_pkg;
logic unused_co
logic p3_ctrl
logic p4_prod_q
begin : ecc_encode
```

<a name="naming-prefixes-suffixes" class="anchor"></a>
### Prefixes and suffixes

Name prefixes are generally used to indicate object types (such as module
instances, flip flops, ports etc), and suffixes are generally used to convey
semantic information. A good standard set of prefixes and suffixes are
enumerated below:

<table class="table table-striped table-sm">
<thead>
  <th scope="col" style="width:20%">Prefix</th>
  <th scope="col">Usage</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td><code>i_</code></td>
  <td>Input port</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>o_</code></td>
  <td>Output port</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>io_</code></td>
  <td>Bidirecitonal (inout) port</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>u_</code></td>
  <td>Module instance</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>m_</code></td>
  <td>Module definition</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>p_</code></td>
  <td>Parameter/localparam</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>g_</code></td>
  <td>Generate block</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>[a-z][0-9]_</code></td>
  <td>Pipeline stage</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>unused_</code></td>
  <td>Unused signal for lint signoff</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<table class="table table-striped table-sm">
<thead>
  <th scope="col" style="width:20%">Suffix</th>
  <th scope="col">Usage</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td><code>_clk</code></td>
  <td>Clock signal</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>_gclk</code></td>
  <td>Gated clock signal</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>_rst</code></td>
  <td>Reset signal</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>_q</code></td>
  <td>Signal driven from a flip flop</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>_n</code></td>
  <td>Active-low signal</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>_t</code></td>
  <td>Type via a typedef</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>_pkg</code></td>
  <td>Package</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>_if</code></td>
  <td>Interface</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Where signals are both active-low and require a suffix from elsewhere in the
table, the `_n` suffix should be appended without an extra underscore. For
example, `_q` becomes `_qn` for an active-low flop output, and `_clk` becomes
`_clkn` for an inverted clock.

The following code example shows appropriate usage of the above prefix and
suffix guidelines:

``` verilog
module m_ctrl_fsm (
  input logic         i_clk,
  input logic         i_rst,
  input logic         i_ready,
  input logic         i_done,
  output logic [2:0]  o_control
);

  typedef enum logic [2:0] {
    IDLE = 3'b000,
    LOAD = 3'b110,
    DONE = 3'b001
  } state_t;

  state_t state_q;
  state_t next;

  assign o_control = state_q;

  always_ff @(posedge i_clk or posedge i_rst) begin
    if (i_rst) begin
      state_q <= IDLE;
    end else begin
      state_q <= next;
    end
  end

  always_comb begin
    unique case (state_q)
      IDLE: if (i_ready) next = LOAD;
            else         next = IDLE;
      LOAD: if (i_done)  next = DONE;
            else         next = LOAD;
      DONE:              next = IDLE;
    endcase
  end

endmodule
```

Another example illustrates the use of the pipeline prefix, using `e` to denote
an external signal and `p` an internal one:

``` verilog
module m_mempipe (
  input  logic        i_clk,
  input  logic        i_rst,
  input  logic        i_e1_valid,
  input  logic [18:2] i_e1_addr,
  output logic [31:0] o_e2_data
);
  ...
  logic        p2_valid_q;
  logic [31:0] p2_data;
  logic [31:0] p3_data_q;
  ...

  always_ff @(posedge i_clk or posedge i_rst) begin
    if (i_rst) begin
      p3_data_q <= 32'h00000000;
    end else if (e2_valid_q) begin
      p3_data_q <= p2_data;
    end
  end

  assign o_e2_data = p3_data_q;

endmodule
```

<a name="signal-naming" class="anchor"></a>
### Signal naming

A strict approach to signal naming should be taken to make it easier to
understand and navigate a design:

**To make clear their relationship to the structure of a module**. Prefixes and
suffices can denote, for example, whether a signal is an input or output, the
pipeline stage it corresponds to and whether it is driven by logic or directly
from a flip-flop. The exact naming convention will be tailored to a project,
but here are some examples:

``` verilog
i_p0_operand     // Input into pipeline stage 0.
p1_state         // A current state of a state machine.
p1_state_ns      // The next state.
state_clk        // A clock signal.
m1_sum_co_unused // An unused carryout bit from an addition.
m2_result_ff     // A registered result, driven by a flip-flop.
o_x4_state       // An output signal driven from stage x4.
```

**To allow simple sorting and searching in wave viewer**. By using common
prefixes for related signals, sorting will place them together. Similarly,
common substrings are useful to filter a subset of signals over, for example to
select a set of registers or similar signals different in pipeline stages.

**To be flattened sensibly by downstream tools**. It is typical for synthesis
to flatten the hierarchical structure of a SystemVerilog design. Consequently
symbols names are derived from their place in the module hierarchy. A suitable
naming scheme really only requires consistency across a design. As an example,
a flip-flop clock pin might be named
`u_toplevel_u_submodule_p0_signal_q_reg_17_/CK` corresponding to the register
`u_toplevel/u_submodule/p0_signal_q[17]`.

<a name="generate-naming" class="anchor"></a>
### Generate block naming

**All scopes of a generate block should be named.** This avoids
automatically-assigned names being created by the elaboration tool, making it
hard to understand the structure of the code. This applies to branches of
conditional and loop statements. For example, with named conditions:

``` verilog
module m_gen_cond #(
    parameter p_gen_diff = 0)();
  logic gen_op0;
  logic gen_op1;
  logic gen_op2;
  generate
    if (p_gen_diff == 1) begin
      assign gen_op0 = 1'b1;
    end else begin
      assign gen_op0 = 1'b0;
    end
    if (p_gen_diff == 1) begin
      assign gen_op1 = 1'b1;
    end else begin
      assign gen_op1 = 1'b0;
    end
    if (p_gen_diff == 1) begin : g_eq_1
      assign gen_op2 = 1'b1;
    end else begin : g_eq_0
      assign gen_op2 = 1'b0;
    end
  endgenerate
endmodule
```

In the resulting hierarchy, the first two conditionals are not easily
distinguishable, nor are the branches that are chosen:

``` verilog
m_gen_cond
  g_eq_0
  genblk1
  genblk2
```

With named loops, a similar situation arises:

``` verilog
module m_gen_loop #(
    parameter p_gen_diff = 0)();
  logic [2:0] gen_op0;
  logic [2:0] gen_op1;
  logic [2:0] gen_op2;
  generate
    for (genvar i=0; i<3; i++) begin
      assign gen_op0[i] = 1'b0;
    end
    for (genvar i=0; i<3; i++) begin
      assign gen_op1[i] = 1'b0;
    end
    for (genvar i=0; i<3; i++) begin : g_loop
      assign gen_op2[i] = 1'b0;
    end
  endgenerate
endmodule
```

In the resulting hierarchy, there is no correspondence to the blocks assigning
to gen_op0 or gen_op1, indeed these could be switched with no visibility in the
hierarchy:

``` verilog
m_gen_loop
  g_loop[0]
  g_loop[1]
  g_loop[2]
  genblk1[0]
  genblk1[1]
  genblk1[2]
  genblk2[0]
  genblk2[1]
  genblk2[2]
```

Using a `g_` prefix for named generate blocks, clearly distinguishes with
instantiations of modules, for example:

``` verilog
module m_foo (
...
);
  m_child u_child (...);
  generate
    for (genvar i-0; i < 3; i++) begin : g_loop
      ...
    end
  endgenerate
endmodule
```

Has the hierarchy:

``` verilog
m_foo
u_child
g_loop
```


<a name="code-structure" class="anchor"></a>
## Code structure

<a name="modules" class="anchor"></a>
### Modules

**Place parameters and variables at the top of their containing scope.**
Nets/variables/parameters should be declared in the minimum scope in which they
will be used to avoid polluting namespaces. For example, nets global to a
module should be declared at the top of the module for use in the code that
follows.

**Separate combinatorial and sequential nets.** Declarations of combinatorial
and sequential nets should be separated into different sections for clarity.
This allows the flip-flops in the design to be seen clearly providing a feel
for the size and complexity of the block. The following ripple-carry adder with
registered outputs illustrates this kind of structuring:

``` verilog
module m_rca
  #(parameter p_width = 8)
  ( input  logic               i_clk,
    input  logic               i_rst,
    input  logic [p_width-1:0] i_op1,
    input  logic [p_width-1:0] i_op2,
    output logic               o_co,
    output logic [p_width-1:0] o_sum );

  // Wires.
  logic [p_width-1:0] carry;
  // Registers.
  logic [p_width-1:0] sum_q;
  logic               co_q;
  // Variables.
  genvar              i;

  assign carry[0] = 1'b0;
  assign {o_co, o_sum} = {co_q, sum_q};

  // Named generate block for per-bit continuous assignments.
  for (i = 0; i < p_width; i = i + 1) begin: bit
    assign {carry[i+1], sum[i]} = i_op1[i] + i_op2[i] + carry[i];
  end

  always_ff @(posedge i_clk or posedge i_rst) begin
    if (i_rst) begin
      sum_q <= {p_width{1'b0}};
      co_q  <= 1'b0;
    end else begin
      sum_q <= sum;
      co_q  <= carry[p_width-1];
    end
  end

endmodule
```

**Use `.*` and `.name()` syntax in some circumstances to simplify port lists in module
instantiations.** Doing so can reduce the amount of boilerplate code and thus the
scope for typing or copy-paste errors. The wildcard `.*` also provides additional checks:[^wildcards]

- It requires all nets be connected.
- It requires all nets to be the same size.
- It prevents implicit nets from being inferred.

Named connections with `.name()` can be used with wildcards to add specific
exceptions, such as when names do not match or for unconnected or tied-off
ports. For example:

``` verilog
module foo (input logic i_clk,
            input logic i_rst,
            input logic in,
            output logic out);
  ...
endmodule

u_module foo (.*,
              .in(in),
              .out(out));
```

Bear in mind that implicit hookups with wildcards may obscure module
connectivity when navigating source code during debug. It is up to the designer
to make the right tradeoff. Specific examples of where wildcard hookups are
useful are in wrapper modules and testbenches.

[^wildcards]: See Section 7 of 'Synthesizing SystemVerilog: Busting the Myth
  that SystemVerilog is only for Verification (linked in the references).

**Avoid logic in module instantiations.** By instantiating a module with a set
of named signals, mapping one-to-one with ports, it is easier to inspect the
port hookups and the widths of the signals for correctness. Not doing so
obscures functionality in the design.

**In parameter lists, separate parameters that are intended to be set
externally from secondary parameters that are only used internally.** There is
no way to prevent some parameters being set externally, ie with `localparam`,
so a comment can be used to do this, for example:

``` verilog
module m_rf
#(parameter
  p_entry_width = 32,
  p_num_entries = 64,
  // Internal parameter(s) - do not set.
  p_idx_width = $clog2(p_num_entries-1))
( ...,
  input logic [p_entry_width-1:0] wr_data,
  input logic [p_idx_width-1:0] wr_idx,
  input logic wr_en,
...
);
```

**Name scopes that contain local variables.** For similar reasons to the naming
of generate blocks, if a variable is declared in a local scope, that scope must
be named. It may be useful to introduce named local scopes to separate a large
module into sections. For example:

``` verilog
begin : p0
  ...
end
begin : p1
  ...
end
```

**Any unused or dangling signals/ports within a block must be terminated with a
signal prefixed with `unused_`.** These signals can be AND-reduced to make a
single-bit signal. The AND-reduction with constant zeros guarantees the result
is always zero, so it can be safely optimised away. For example:

``` verilog
logic _unused_ok = &{1'b0,
                     sig_not_used_a,
                     sig_not_used_yet_b // To be fixed
                     };
```

<a name="packages" class="anchor"></a>
### Packages

**Define packages to share definitions (types, constants, tasks, functions etc)
between multiple modules or IPs.**

**Qualify types, constants, tasks or functions with their package name and
avoid \* imports.** This resolves any potential ambiguity in the providence of
symbols to the designer and avoids polluting the current scope with all names
defined by the package. For example:

``` verilog
// Avoid
import m_core_pkg::*;

// Prefer
m_core_pkg::FIFO_RAM_WIDTH
m_core_pkg::grey_code(...)
```


<a name="assertions" class="anchor"></a>
### Assertions

**Assertions should be written in a separate file that is bound in to the
appropriate scope.** Verification tests must be written to specifically ensure
that the assertions are present in simulation.

**Assertion files must be named after the block they apply to, with an
`_assert.sv` suffix.** Where assertions have been split into different groups
to allow use in gate-level simulations (or other environments), the file name
may have a `_ports_assert.sv`, `_regs_assert.sv` or `_nets_assert.sv` suffix as
appropriate.

### Preprocessor

**In general, it should be possible to avoid any preprocessing of code.** Other
built-in language structures such as parameters and generate statements should
be used instead. Don't use local `define` statements in modules unless
absolutely necessary, use `localparam` instead of `define`:

``` verilog
// Avoid
`define CONSTANT 1

// Prefer
localparam p_constant = 1;
```

This is because SystemVerilog macro definitions are not scoped within a module,
which can easily lead to them 'leaking' between files in a filelist, making the
elaboration dependent on the ordering of the list.

For similar reasons, **use generate-if blocks instead of `ifdef`.**

``` verilog
// Avoid
`ifdef FLAG
...
`endif

// Prefer
generate
  if (p_flag) begin
  ...
  end
endgenerate
```

**If a local define is unavoidable, then a corresponding `undef` must be included
before the end of the file.** This is to avoid macro definitions polluting the
global namespace.

``` verilog
`define LOCAL_DEFINE

...

// End of the file or use of LOCAL_DEFINE
`undef LOCAL_DEFINE
```

## Formatting

Rules for formatting are not mandated so to provide some flexibility to
designer's own tastes and the inevitable exceptions to rules. Above all, the
most important issue with formatting is to maintain consistency within a
logical part of the design.

**Use spaces instead of tabs**, consistent with the accepted approach in other
programming languages for compatibility with version control and editors etc.

**Split long lines or complex expressions with continuations or across
statements.** Apply indent as appropriate  for clarity. In this context, 'long'
is a reasonable value chosen by the author, but typically between 80 and 120
characters.

**Use begin and end to wrap `if`/`else`, `always_ff` and `always_comb`
blocks.** This adds consistency to the code and can help to prevent statements
from unintentionally being excluded from a block. Only use begin and end in
case alternatives when they contain multiple statements.

## Summary

SystemVerilog is a large language with many features supporting different
purposes. It is used as a standard in hardware design but its specification
does not define a synthesizable subset. Although there is a general consensus
on which features can be used for synthesis, the fine details are determined by
the particular EDA tooling flow used by a design team. SystemVerilog is
consequently used in a conservative way for specifying synthesizable designs.
The rules and rationale given in this note outline some of the important
aspects of a coding style for hardware design. There are many more details of
SystemVerilog's features that are relevant; the references below are a good
place to find out more.
