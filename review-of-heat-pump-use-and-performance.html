<p><strong><em><span class="caps">NOTE</span>:</em></strong>  Updated October 2024 with improved&nbsp;charts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had a Vaillant heat pump installed in my house in July 2022, and a year later
a <a href="https://www.vaillant.co.uk/product-systems/smart-controls/myvaillant-connect-internet-gateway">Vaillant gateway</a>, which provides monitoring and logging services
via the &#8216;myVaillant&#8217; smartphone app. Since I now have a year&#8217;s worth of data,
this note reviews what has been logged to see how the system is&nbsp;performing.</p>
<div class="text-center">

  </a>
</div>

<p>The heat pump is a 10 kW Vaillant Arotherm plus (pictured above), serving my
house of approximately 90 square meters internal area. I have previously posted
about the building&#8217;s <a href="home-thermal-imaging-survey.html">energy efficiency</a> and
<a href="cornish-unit-house-retrofit-insulation.html">additional first floor
insulation</a> added. This pump&#8217;s
capacity exceeds the current requirements of the house, but we are planning an
extension in the near&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>In terms of the operation of the heating and hot water system, space heating is
set to run continuously with a fixed temperature of 19 degrees C is set in the
downstairs hallway (a central point in the house), and hot water is set to run
continuously at 50 degrees C. In the first year of running the system, I
experimented with running heating and hot water for set periods during each day
of the week, but I found that the heat pump had to work hard to bring the
system and the fabric of the house back up to temperature.<br>
I was advised that continuous operation was more efficient and since
the house is almost always occupied, this matched our use. At that point I
hadn&#8217;t taken a close look at the measured performance and was just ad-hoc
monitoring the electricity demand, so it is not to say that running the system
with setback temperatures would not be effective and may better match occupancy
(see analysis from <a href="https://www.heatgeek.com/should-your-heating-be-left-on-all-the-time-or-not">Heatgeek</a> or <a href="https://protonsforbreakfast.wordpress.com/2022/12/19/setback-should-you-lower-heating-overnight">Protons for Breakfast</a>),
but having a continuous temperature is the most comfortable and works well in my&nbsp;case.</p>
<p>The <em>myVaillant</em> app usefully provides a button to download all logged data per
year in a set of <span class="caps">CSV</span> files and this code is <a href="https://github.com/jameshanlon/home-energy-data">available on
Github</a>. I have summarised the year period from July 2023 to
July 2024 in the following charts. Having read this <a href="https://protonsforbreakfast.wordpress.com/2023/02/06/the-myvaillant-app-a-review"><span class="caps">PFB</span> review</a>,
I am aware that there are issues with the quality of the logged data.
The review measured a ~8% error in electricity consumed and a ~20% error in the heat
energy produced, as well as pointing out many logged values are quantised to
kWh units, which I also observe in my data. Significantly, this means that the
raw Vaillant data under reports <span class="caps">COP</span>. I don&#8217;t have a point of comparison with
with an alternative measurement of the consumed and generated energy (although I
would like to install an <a href="https://openenergymonitor.org">OpenEnergyMonitor</a> to do this). 
Despite the potential inaccuracies of the Vaillant data, it remains useful for
a high-level review of the&nbsp;system.</p>
<h1>Analysis</h1>
<p>The overall performance of the system for the year from July 2023 to July 2024
is summarised in the following&nbsp;table.</p>
<table class="table">

    <tr>

      <td>6.65 kWh</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Heat generated heating</td>
      <td>4.91 MWh</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Heat generated hot water</td>
      <td>3.13 MWh</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Total <span class="caps">SCOP</span></td>
      <td>3.41</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Note that when scaling consumed electricity by 8% and generated electicity by
20% to adjust for possible inaccuracy, heating <span class="caps">SCOP</span> is 4.06, hot water <span class="caps">SCOP</span> is
3.43 and they are combined at 3.79. Note also, that these figures do not include
the electicity used for the weekly Legionella purge performed by an immersion
heater I have installed in my&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>Looking more closely at consumption, the chart below shows all measurements
over this period for heating, hot water and their&nbsp;combination.</p>
<div class="text-center">
<figure class="figure">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid" src="https://jwh.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/homepage/heat-pump/consumed.png" alt="Electrical energy consumed in kWh.">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-left">Electrical energy consumed in kWh.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Most obviously, electricity consumption during the winter months increases
significantly when the heat pump is using approximately 10 kWh per day. There
are two spikes in November and January where temperatures went below zero, and
at these times consumption went up close to 30 kWh per day. As expected,
electricity consumption for hot water is more consistent throughout the year
with a lesser increase through the winter months. The short periods where both
drop to zero are due either to a holiday and the system being in &#8216;absence&#8217; mode
or a technical issue. Regarding the latter, these have only been due to a loss
of pressure in the system, requiring a manual top up from the mains water&nbsp;supply.</p>
<p>The next chart is the heat energy generated, which is tightly correlated with
the consumption&nbsp;graph.</p>
<div class="text-center">
<figure class="figure">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid" src="https://jwh.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/homepage/heat-pump/generated.png" alt="Heat energy generated (hot water and heating) in kWh.">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-left">Heat energy generated (hot water and heating) in kWh.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Combining the previous two charts by calculating the ratio between generated and
consumed, gives the coefficient of performance (<span class="caps">COP</span>).</p>
<div class="text-center">
<figure class="figure">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid" src="https://jwh.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/homepage/heat-pump/COP.png" alt="COP calculated by dividing heat generated by electrical energy consumed.">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-left"><span class="caps">COP</span> calculated by dividing heat generated by electrical energy consumed.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>And perhaps more digestably, <span class="caps">COP</span> averaged over weekly&nbsp;intervals.</p>
<div class="text-center">
<figure class="figure">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid" src="https://jwh.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/homepage/heat-pump/weekly-COP.png" alt="Weekly averaged COP.">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-left">Weekly averaged <span class="caps">COP</span>.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The next chart is a different presentation of the data, with <span class="caps">COP</span> plotted as a function of heat
output. I would expect there to be an output level that achieves peak efficiency, but there is
little reduction in efficiency between that and the highest recorded&nbsp;output.</p>
<div class="text-center">
<figure class="figure">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid" src="https://jwh.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/homepage/heat-pump/heat-output-vs-COP.png" alt="Heat output versus weeekly averaged COP.">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-left">Heat output versus weeekly averaged <span class="caps">COP</span>.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Looking at the temperature of the hot water tank, this stays constant as expected
but with a few exceptions: when I changed the temperature from 45 to 50 degrees C
in October 2023; when the system has been off or out of order; and when every week
on a Monday the immersion heater kicks in to perform a Legionella purge (which
curiously it has stopped since March 2024, something I need to&nbsp;investigate).</p>
<div class="text-center">
<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-left">Hot water temperature in degrees Celsius.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Finally, we have a plot of internal (red) vs external (blue) temperature in
degrees C. This clearly shows that the 19 degrees C target was maintained
throughout the year, notwithstanding the periods of absence/downtime and on
particular hot days when the temperature rose above the target. Given how
quickly our summers are changing in terms of heat waves, having a system that
can also perform cooling would be a big benefit. I think this chart well represents
the benefit of having a heat pump, and a home with a continuous temperature
throughout the&nbsp;year.</p>

  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-left">Internal and external temperatures in degrees Celsius.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>For the same period I obtained the electricity use and cost data from Octopus
using their excellent <span class="caps">API</span> via the <a href="https://github.com/Yanson/octograph">Octograph tool</a>, visualised below
on a Grafana dashboard. According to the Vaillant data, the heat pump used 2.39
MWh of energy, which is only 32% of the total electricity use. I am suspicious
that this is incorrect, even factoring in an 8% underestimate from the Vaillant
measurements. I would expect the heat pump to be using more like half of total
electricity on average, given that other electricity use is cooking and
appliances etc, but perhaps I am wrong. Otherwise the usage profile matches between
the two data&nbsp;sets.</p>
